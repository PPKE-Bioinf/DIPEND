NOTE 2 [file check.top, line 18030]:
  System has non-zero total charge: 6.000000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See

NOTE 3 [file /media/zita/420035510C1C3397/Research-from-2016-09-30/Scripts/DIPEND/Data/em.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.
